DarkIce Frequenty Asked Questions


Q: I get the following error:

DarkIce: LameLibEncoder.cpp:75: lame lib opening underlying sink error [0]

What am I doing wrong?


A: This error means (quite anti-intuitively), that darkice coulnd't connect
   to the streaming server. Please double-check the following values in
   your config file:
    - server
    - port
    - password

   If you're streaming to a shoutcast server, make sure that the port
   you use is the _source_ port, which is usually 1 above the _client_
   port for shoutcast (the defaults are 8000 for client, 8001 for source).
