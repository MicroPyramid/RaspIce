/*! \class aflibConverter
    \brief Provides sample rate conversion.

 This class will perform audio resampling. With the constructor you can choose the
 type of resampling to be done. Simple linear interpolation can be done by setting
 linear_interpolation to be TRUE in the constructor. The other two flags are 
 ignored if this is set. If linear_interpolation is FALSE then some form of filtering
 will be done. IF high_quality is FALSE then a small filter will be performed. 
 If high_quality is TRUE then a large filter (higher quality) will be performed. For
 both the small and large filters another parameter can be specified, filter_interpolation.
 With filter_interpolation set then the filter coefficients used for both the small and
 large filtering will be interpolated as well.

 This class was designed to stream audio data. It also expects audio data as 16 bit values.
 Each time a new stream is started some initialization needs to be done. Thus the function
 initialize should be called to initialize everything. This initialize function will set
 the conversion factor as well as a multiplecation factor for volume. The volume only
 applies to the small and large filter. Since this filter uses a history of the audio data
 it is possible for it to vary in amplitude. This allows users to scale the data. This
 class will work on any number of channels. Once everything is specified then resample
 should be called as many times as is necessary to process all the data. The value
 inCount will be returned indicating how many inArray samples were actually used to
 produce the output. This value can be used to indicate where the next block of
 inArray data should start. The resample function is driven by the outCount value
 specified. The inArray should contain at least:
    outCount / factor + extra_samples.
 extra_samples depends on the type of filtering done. As a rule of thumb 50 should be
 adequate for any type of filter.
