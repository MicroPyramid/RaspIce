Description: Live audio streamer
 raspice is an IceCast2 live audio streamer. It
 takes audio input from a sound card, encodes it into mp3 and sends the mp3 stream to one or more IceCast servers, DarkIce uses lame as a shared object as its mp3 encoder.

 NOTE: The Debian version of RaspIce is only compiled with lame
 support and therefore only work with IceCast2
 servers!
