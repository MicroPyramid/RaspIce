15-07-2013 Darkice 1.2 released
    o Issue #75: Added Ogg/Opus support. Patch by Doug Kelly
	dougk.ff7@gmail.com
    o Fix 'Ring Ruffer' reports.
      - Increased buffer for jack to 5 seconds
      - prevent darkice termination by jack, report no fatal problem when we
        have a ringbuffer overflow, can happen during startup
        If we can not handle input audio fast enough we just ignore the buffer
        and skip it, and just report it.
      - new multithreaded connector code, now handles encoders in parallel
        and does not spin waiting, cpu load will be very much lower now
        Codes uses 2 condition variables to report data availability and
        consumer thread availability
      - Hopes are that glitching reports will be a thing of the past
      - minor compiler warnings fixed
        (Fix by Edwin van den Oetelaar)
