1. What is DarkIce?
-------------------

DarkIce is an IceCast, IceCast2 and ShoutCast live audio streamer. It
takes audio input from a sound card, encodes it into mp3 and/or Ogg Vorbis,
and sends the mp3 stream to one or more IceCast and/or ShoutCast servers,
the Ogg Vorbis stream to one or more IceCast2 servers.
